\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

  The multigroup neutron diffusion equation has been demonstrated as a useful
  model for the neutron distribution in a typical nuclear power reactor. With
  the development of the \gls{nem}, the model was made more efficient and
  computational time was significantly decreased. The typical quantities of
  interest in these reactor simulations is the fundamental mode of the
  eigenvalue problem; that is, the largest eigenvalue and associated scalar flux
  distribution.

  Traditionally, the multigroup neutron diffusion equation has been solved using
  the \gls{pi} method. The \gls{pi} method is a fixed-point method useful for
  solving eigenvalue problems. It is a linear iteration method and converges to
  the fundamental eigenmode with $q$-linear convergence rate.  Recently, work
  has investigated the use of \gls{jfnk} methods in an attempt to improve the
  computational efficiency of solving the multigroup neutron diffusion equation.
  \gls{jfnk} methods are attractive because when the iteration terminates, the
  method has $q$-quadratic convergence rate. However, \gls{jfnk} methods require
  the computation of quantities not required by the \gls{pi} method including
  the finite difference approximate Jacobian. Due to the challenges of computing
  these quantities, the implementation of \gls{jfnk} methods for computing the
  fundamental mode to the multigroup neutron diffusion equation remains an
  active area of research.

  In \citetitle{qe2paper}, \citeauthor{qe2paper} explore an implementation of
  the \gls{jfnk} that seeks to be efficiently solve the \gls{nem} equations for
  the fundamental eigenmode. \sref{sec:summary} provides a brief summary of this
  work and a few considerations for solving the multigroup neutron diffusion
  equation using \gls{jfnk} methods. Then, \sref{sec:critique} critiques the
  author's implementation with a focus on the applicability of the proposed
  method to realistic nuclear power reactor simulations. Finally,
  \sref{sec:conclusion} provides a few conclusions based on the work by
  \citeauthor{qe2paper} and provides an some considerations for future
  implementation of the \gls{jfnk} method.
