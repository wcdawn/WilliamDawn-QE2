\section{Conclusions and Implications}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Multiphysics \glsentryshort{jfnk}}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \citeauthor{qe2paper} claim their method will be extended to include
      multiphysics feedback.
    \item \citeauthor{caslJFNK} present results for multiphysics \gls{jfnk}.
    \item It was concluded that cross section processing was prohibitively
      inefficient.
    \item Required reactor-specific cross section derivatives.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proposed Future Investigations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Compare proposed \gls{jfnk} implementation to a \gls{pi} method with
      the \gls{ws}.
    \item Investigate other preconditioners including \gls{pi} preconditioner.
    \item Implement a \gls{cmfd} formulation to reduce the number of solving
      variables.
  \end{itemize}
